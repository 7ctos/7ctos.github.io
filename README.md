# Introduction

As a CTO, the role is more than managing technology; it’s about understanding how technology drives business success. This manifesto is not a set of rigid rules but a guiding framework—rooted in collaboration, grounded in strategy, and focused on creating real impact. It recognizes the complexity of leading in today’s world and offers principles to navigate it with humility, precision, and purpose.

# CTO Manifesto

The CTO first and foremost grasps the business growth engine. They have a vision for the technology needed and the financial savvy to bring it to reality. The CTO then assembles a team and leads them with precision to build the technology that fuels the engine.

# Guiding Principles
