# Contributing

In order to add your name to the list of signatories of the CTO Manifesto, follow these instructions:

1. Create a fork of this [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/7ctos/7ctos.github.io). _Note: Do not just clone the repo, as you won't be able to push your changes directly back to this repository_
2. In your newly-created fork of the repository, you can now edit the `docs/SIGNATORIES.md` file. You can do this directly in the Github UI by navigating to that file, clicking the ✏️ icon, adding your line, and committing your changes.
3. When you are satisfied with your additions, navigate back to the main page of your repository (the **Code** tab), and you'll see a notification that says "This branch is x commits ahead of `7ctos/7ctos.github.io:main`". Click **Contribute** and then **Open Pull Request**
4. In the **Title** field, say "Adding {your name}"
5. Click "Create Pull Request"
